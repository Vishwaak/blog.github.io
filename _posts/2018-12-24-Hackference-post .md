### Hackference India 2018


My journey to hackference starts from Karaikal,Tamil Nadu a day before the event starts. It was a 12-hour journey from my place to Bangalore it was my second solo travel to a place. The bus I booked was double-decker it was my first experience in such a bus. It totally felt like a bed to sleep on. The journey was comfortable.



Morning of the event I reached Bangalore it was freaking 17 Celsius outside I was like enough I wore a jacket to protect me from the cold. I stayed over in a relatives house and from there my destination in White field was 45mins away. I booked a taxi and reached the place. This was where the real fun was there were two building of exactly of same size and dimension with people buzzing at the front gate I thought that would be the gateway to my place. I stood there for the next 20 mins in the entrance of the wrong building and when I enquired about the address it was the adjacent building and the adjacent building was a mall.


Once I reached the front gate of the mall we had volunteers who took as to the place of the event K-Start. Such a wonderful place with a beautiful ambient. The conference started at 10 'o clock in the morning.We had talks from various speakers like Karthik Padmanabhan and Julia Aslamova. I had a nice time meeting and talking with people like Subhendu Panigrahi, CEO of Skillenza. Most of the talks were revolving around the word, community.  Later on, it was the most important part of the day lunch break time. The food they served were hand cooked and was also very delicious causes it was made by the Love and care by the mom in Bangalore. post lunch was a rapid-fire round between the speakers. The whole conference revolved around the building the developer community and developer relation. Last but not the least the google cupcake was the tasty snack of the day. The whole experience was a very wonderful one for the first time OSS Event. Wish I attend more of this event in the future.
